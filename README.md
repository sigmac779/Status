## Working Flow !!

- **Monetize Content**: Users can easily monetize their content/ work .

- **Unique Digital Assets**: Each ticket is represented as a unique digital asset called an NFT (non-fungible token), ensuring it has its own digital identity that can't be replicated or divided.

- **Buy and Resell**: Anyone can buy these content/work products from the   owner, and once someone owns an NFT, they can resell it to others.

- **Experience Gather**: Participant can  share  their experience  after the events ends. So that other users can get  the idea  of the user work
